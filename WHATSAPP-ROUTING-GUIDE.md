- **Keyword Extraction**: Domain-specific entity recognition

### **2. Routing Decision**
The system matches messages using:
- **AI Category Mapping**: Maps AI categories to issue categories
- **Keyword Matching**: Matches message keywords to category keywords  
- **Intent Recognition**: Routes based on detected user intent
- **Severity Detection**: Determines urgency level (High/Medium/Low)

### **3. Message Routing**
For matched categories:
- **Formatted Alert**: Creates rich WhatsApp alert with all context
- **Group Delivery**: Sends to configured WhatsApp group(s)
- **Slack Notification**: Optional Slack channel notification
- **Audit Logging**: Records routing decision and outcome
